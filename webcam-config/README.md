If the capture rate of your camera is lower than it is supposed to be try to change the settings of your webcam by using `Guvcview`.

### Installation: 
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install guvcview
```
Now open Guvcview and import the sample profile: `Logitech_Brio_4K_Webcam.gpfl`\
We use the `Logitech Brio 4K Webcam`. For other webcams, the settings might be different.\
After that, the capture rate should be higher.
